// Cond implements a condition variable, a rendezvous point
// for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence
// of an event.
//
// Each Cond has an associated Locker L (often a *sync.Mutex or *sync.RWMutex),
// which must be held when changing the condition and
// when calling the Wait method.

// Wait atomically unlocks c.L and suspends execution
// of the calling goroutine. After later resuming execution,
// Wait locks c.L before returning. Unlike in other systems,
// Wait cannot return unless awoken by Broadcast or Signal.
//
// Because c.L is not locked when Wait first resumes, the caller
// typically cannot assume that the condition is true when
// Wait returns. Instead, the caller should Wait in a loop:
//
//	c.L.Lock()
//	for !condition() {
//	    c.Wait()
//	}
//	... make use of condition ...
//	c.L.Unlock()

	<-w       // waits for signal on copy

//
// It is allowed but not required for the caller to hold c.L
// during the call.

// during the call.
